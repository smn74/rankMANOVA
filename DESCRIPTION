Description: Implemented are an ANOVA-type test statistic for testing hypotheses formulated in Mann-Whitney-type effects in nonparametric factorial designs. Statistical inference is based on a wild or a sample-specific 
         bootstrap approach. The unweighted treatment effects considered do not depend on sample sizes and allow for
         transitive ordering. The package thus provides an extension of the univariate rankFD package to multivariate 
         data.
